# Kirp's Quest

Trying to build a 2D RPG using an exploratory architecture as opposed to starting with classes and a design in mind.  I'm making everything in a monolithic main function and seeing what patters emerge.  Once they emerge, I will pull them out into classes.  This way the architecture will be designed as the game develops instead of the other way around.
